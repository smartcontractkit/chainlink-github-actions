# Mono Repo for Reusable Public Chainlink Github Actions

Place your action in a logically named folder with the action.yml and README.md and anything else required for your action.

Currently we will be versioning all actions at once with github releases/tags. In the future we can look into using something like `changesets` which is used by external-adapters-js to version independent actions.
